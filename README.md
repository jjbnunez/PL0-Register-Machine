A school homework project I feel inclined to revisit years after failing it the first time.

Back when I was an undergrad in UCF, I took a "Systems Software" course in Fall of 2017.

In reality, the class focused essentially on compiler design.

I managed to pass the class by scoring well on the exams, but it irks me that, among all of the classes I took, this was the only class in which I could not successfully complete the project.

I still have the "dragon book". I want to do this right this time.
